# Symmetric
This project implements symmetric/multigenerational equations for wood laminates derived in the book "Laminated Designs in Wood: Techniques, Patterns, Projects" by Clarence Rannefeld.
Notes on the equations used are in documentation/WidthEquations.pdf (which are further explained in the book) and documentation/HeightEquations.pdf (which are not derived in the book).
